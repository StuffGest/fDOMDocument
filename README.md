> :warning: **Initial project is Archived**
> There will be no new features or general bugfixes. In case you found a security problem, please contact me and I'll consider creating an additional release addressing it. Otherwise no updates are planned. The current (potentially final) release `1.6.7` should work under PHP 5.3.3 - PHP 8.1.

The classes contained within this repository extend the standard DOM to use exceptions at
all occasions of errors instead of PHP warnings or notices. They also add various custom methods
and shortcuts for convenience and to simplify the usage of DOM.
